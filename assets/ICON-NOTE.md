# Extension Icon

The current `extension-icon.png` is a placeholder copied from the air-quality extension.

You should replace it with a proper Logseq-themed icon (512x512px PNG).

Possible icon ideas:
- Logseq logo
- Graph/network symbol
- Search + knowledge graph combination
- Book with magnifying glass
